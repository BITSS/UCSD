#Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS)

##UC San Diego, February 10-11, 2016.
--------------------------------------

Welcome! This repository contains the materials for both the  BITSS Wednesday seminar and the Thursday workshop. Files are also stored [here](https://osf.io/fdwyx/) on the Open Science Framework (OSF).

Thursday we we will be focusing on software tools for a reproducible workflow, specifically:

1. Version Control
2. Dynamic documents in both R and Stata. ([Dynamic documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) are ones that contain code, analysis, and output all in one place, for better organization and reproducibility.)

There are three important folders:

1. slides--contains a set of intro slides written in beamer (LaTeX).
2. Rmarkdown-Stata--contains files for writing a simple dynamic document using R Markdown in R Studio with knitr. Also contains files to run a two-step somewhat-dynamic document version of things using Stata and LaTeX separately. (This folder has its own Readme.)
3. haghish--contains files from Haghish with a demo of a native-Stata dynamic document (Markdoc)

In order to work with these files, you're going to need to have several software programs installed. We will be running a demo of them, but it will likely be a lot more useful if you try and follow along on your own. 

1. [LaTeX](https://latex-project.org/ftp.html) (install--this is a pretty big download. Please don't leave this until the day of.)
3. [GitHub.com](http://github.com) (make an account)
4. [Git](https://desktop.github.com/) (install--this actually links to GitHub Desktop, which includes Git)
5. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (install)
6. [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) (install)
7. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) (install)
8. Stata (sorry, we can't help you get a copy of this.)

I wrote a blogpost describing the above software to install, which you can find [here](http://www.bitss.org/2016/01/08/open-source-software-for-reproducible-social-science/).
