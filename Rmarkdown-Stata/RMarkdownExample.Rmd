```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Permanently set echo OFF!
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Loading the data
----------------
You can bring in the Stata data directly with the 'foreign' package.
You only have to install a package once, but you have to load the library every time.
```{r, echo = FALSE }
#install.packages("foreign")
library(foreign)
setwd ("C:/Users/garret/Documents/Research/BITSS/WorkshopSlides/Annual2015/RMarkdown-Stata")
WASHB<-read.dta("WASHBpublic_mock.dta")
```

Running Analysis
-----------------
I ran some regression analysis. The results are good.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Model 1=simple model
model1<-lm(free_chl_yn~treatw, data=WASHB)
#Model 2=with hetero-robust se's--a bit more complicated than Stata
#install.packages("sandwich")
library(sandwich)
cov <- vcovHC(model1, type = "HC")
robust.se <- sqrt(diag(cov))
#Model 3=add baseline control variables
model3<-lm(free_chl_yn~treatw+kiswahili+english, data=WASHB)
```

Graphics
========
Graphics can be easily inlaid.
Here, I'll make a map of the number of US military recruits to a 16 year period by county.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(haz06~waz06, data=WASHB)
```

Equations
==========
Equations written with LaTeX syntax works, so you can write short reports all in one file.
$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = r * N * (1 - \frac{N}{K})$$

Refer to Values
===============
You can refer to values calculated in R by just surrounding "r" and the code with single accent marks. 
For example, the mean frequency is `r mean(WASHB$treatw, na.rm=TRUE)`.


Simple Output
==============
You can just use built in R functionality.

```{r}
summary(model1)
summary(model3)
```

Fancier Output
==============
R Markdown is mostly for simple stuff. Like I said, mark*down*, not mark*up*. But you can still get really nicely formatted regression output with a couple of R packages, xtable or stargazer. (Very similar to estout or outreg2 in Stata.)

Stargazer has three types of output (text, html, and LaTeX). 

<!-- HTML->HTML
--------------
First, I'll do output as html. We can knit right to html here, and it looks great.
-->
```{r, results='asis'}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(model1, model1, model3, se=list(NULL, robust.se, NULL), type="html", out="outputR.html", title="Made Automatically in R", align=TRUE, column.labels=c("default","robust", "controls"))
```

TeX->PDF
---------------
When we Knit a Markdown as a PDF, it actually makes that PDF using LaTeX. (See [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html).) So you can use the .tex output option from stargazer and get nice PDF documentation.

```{r, results='asis'}
stargazer(model1, model1, model3, se=list(NULL, robust.se, NULL), title="Made Automatically in R", out="outputR.tex")
```


Everything All in One Place?
=====================
You can do [citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). Plots, graphs, and citations, what else do you need for a research paper?

Complicated, time consuming for very long articles.

Maybe try Sweave (direct combo of LaTeX and R).

Send your output to .tex files, include those in your master paper file.
